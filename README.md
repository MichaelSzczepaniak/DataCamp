## About me

In the spring of 2008, I took a graduate-level machine learning course as an elective for my BS in Computer Science. That class was quite literally life-changing in that I finally found the work I love. Unfortunately, *Data Scientist* and *Machine Learning Engineer* job didn't exist back then, so I worked as a software engineer from 2008 through 2015.
