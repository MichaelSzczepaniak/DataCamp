    "Every year, American high school students take SATs, which are standardized tests intended to measure literacy, numeracy, and writing skills. There are three sections - reading, math, and writing, each with a **maximum score of 800 points**. These tests are extremely important for students and colleges, as they play a pivotal role in the admissions process.\n",
    "\n",
    "Analyzing the performance of schools is important for a variety of stakeholders, including policy and education professionals, researchers, government, and even parents considering which school their children should attend. \n",

    "You have been provided with a dataset called `schools.csv`, which is previewed below.\n",

    "You have been tasked with answering three key questions about New York City (NYC) public school SAT performance."
